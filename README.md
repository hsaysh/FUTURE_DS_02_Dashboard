## 📌 Project Overview
This project is part of my **Future Interns Data Science & Analytics Internship (Task 2)**.  
The goal was to design a **Social Media Campaign Performance Tracker** in Power BI that gives insights into impressions, clicks, conversions, spending, and campaign effectiveness.

The dashboard highlights **key performance indicators (KPIs)** and provides a breakdown by gender, age, interests, and ad ID.  
I used a **professional modern theme** with consistent colors and intuitive layouts to ensure data storytelling is clear and impactful.
